ERC240160_ENCLOSURE

rotary encoder: solder ribbon cable
(mounted to PCB would have insufficient reach, and mechanically difficult to insert with the LCD FPC soldered on already)

add SPDT switch on left side
and LED?

Fine grid sand paper on top
Printed front panel labels on thick transparency (guerrilla glass?)
-black portions to cover 3d printed inconsistencies




PCB:
-no components on bottom side, besides BUS connector

-header for rotary encoder
